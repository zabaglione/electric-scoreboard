# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RSS ニュース電光掲示板アプリに、アプリケーションの配布機能とOS起動時の自動起動機能を追加します。現在のElectronアプリケーションを、ユーザーが簡単にインストール・配布できる形式にパッケージ化し、システム起動時に自動で開始するオプションを提供します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the RSS news ticker as a standalone application, so that I don't need to have Node.js or development tools installed on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN electron-builder SHALL create platform-specific installers (macOS .dmg, Windows .exe, Linux .AppImage)
2. WHEN a user runs the installer THEN the application SHALL be installed to the appropriate system directory
3. WHEN the application is installed THEN it SHALL appear in the system's application menu/launcher
4. WHEN the application is launched from the system menu THEN it SHALL start normally without requiring command line execution
5. WHEN the application is uninstalled THEN all application files and settings SHALL be properly removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to automatically start the RSS ticker when my computer boots up, so that I can have news updates available immediately after login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the settings window THEN there SHALL be a checkbox option labeled "OS起動時に自動起動する"
2. WHEN the user enables auto-start THEN the application SHALL register itself to start automatically on system boot
3. WHEN the user disables auto-start THEN the application SHALL remove itself from the system startup programs
4. WHEN the system boots and auto-start is enabled THEN the application SHALL start automatically and display the news ticker
5. WHEN auto-start is enabled and the application starts on boot THEN it SHALL start minimized to system tray (if available)
6. WHEN the auto-start setting is changed THEN the setting SHALL be persisted and survive application restarts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the auto-start functionality to work consistently across different operating systems, so that the feature behaves the same regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-start is enabled on macOS THEN the application SHALL be added to Login Items
2. WHEN auto-start is enabled on Windows THEN the application SHALL be added to the Windows Registry startup entries
3. WHEN auto-start is enabled on Linux THEN the application SHALL create a .desktop file in the autostart directory
4. WHEN the application fails to register for auto-start THEN it SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. WHEN checking auto-start status THEN the application SHALL accurately detect if it's currently set to auto-start on the current platform

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be automated and configurable, so that I can easily create releases for multiple platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build command THEN electron-builder SHALL create distributable packages for the target platform
2. WHEN building for release THEN the application SHALL be code-signed (where applicable) and notarized for security
3. WHEN the build process completes THEN the output SHALL include installer files ready for distribution
4. WHEN building for multiple platforms THEN the build configuration SHALL support cross-platform builds where possible
5. WHEN a new version is built THEN the version number SHALL be automatically incremented and included in the package metadata
